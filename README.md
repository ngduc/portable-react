# portable-react

Simple React components written in Typescript using Tailwind CSS, all in one index.tsx file.

### Usage

Just copy [index.tsx](./portable-react/src/index.tsx) file to your project to use it.

Include tailwind.min.css in your index.html using: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/tailwindcss

### Motivation

Often times, when starting a new project, I need to quickly use some basic React components but I don't want to install, set up, import to use a full fledge Component Library yet. Inspired by PortableApps I used in the past (which you can just copy and use one application file anywhere), I created this collection of simple React components, all in one index.tsx file. You can just copy that file to any React project and start using it, tweak it immediately.

P/S: I'm aware of some opinion about the downside of copying code manually, best practices, etc. This is just an experiment for my pet projects. I don't recommend this to be used in any big project. 

### Using npm

For those you want to use npm, install it by running: npm install portable-react --save
